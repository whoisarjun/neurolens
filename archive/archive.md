# 🗃️ Archive Notes

This directory contains early prototype notebooks used during the **v0 phase** of development for the **Building BloCS Hackathon**.

## Files Archived

- 📄 `whisper.ipynb` — Handles audio transcription and segment formatting using Whisper.
- 📄 `speech_tracker.ipynb` — Prototype for analyzing linguistic and temporal features from transcripts to track cognitive patterns across patients.

These two notebooks served as the **initial foundation** for experimentation and feature testing. They were created during the early brainstorming and prototyping stages of the hackathon and contain rough but functional code for speech recognition and tracking workflows.

> ✅ Keep these for reference, but they are **not part of the final production pipeline**.
